üß† What do bias and variance mean in classification?
1.Bias
A high bias means your model is underfitting: it‚Äôs too simple to capture the underlying patterns.
In classification, it reflects how often your average model prediction is wrong compared to the true labels.

2.Variance
Variance measures the sensitivity of the model to small fluctuations in the training dataset.
High variance means your model is overfitting: it captures noise in the training data.
In classification, it reflects how much your model‚Äôs predictions change when trained on different subsets of data.

Bias-Variance Tradeoff
Ideal model: low bias and low variance.

üîç What does the function get_bias_variance do?

mse, bias, var = bias_variance_decomp(
    estimator, 
    X_train=X_train, 
    y_train=y_train, 
    X_test=X_test, 
    y_test=y_test, 
    loss='0-1_loss',  # Classification-specific loss
    random_seed=42
)
loss='0-1_loss' tells the function to use classification error rate as the loss.

It trains the model multiple times on bootstrapped subsets of the training data to estimate:

	1.mse: Mean prediction error (in this case, it's actually classification error).
	2.bias: Error due to wrong average prediction.
	3.var: Error due to prediction variability.
